# **On Tap**

On Tap is a web service that allows you to search for breweries located in the United States. You can find breweries by providing a city and state in the search bar or by selecting the random option or by selecting the specific option which allows you to search by brewery type(mirco, nano, brewpub, etc.).

# **API** 

The API used for this project was [The Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/). This API has many different filter options but in this project I only use about seven of them.

# **Deploying my Website**

I deployed my project by using [Render](https://render.com/), a free version of render was used so if you have a project to deply in the future consider using Render!

# **User Flow**

- User can use the search bar or any filter option that they want to retrieve breweries related with their search.
- The user will be displayed all breweries related to their search and all information for that brewery will be displayed in a box with a review option at the bottom.
- In order to leave a review the user must signup and create an account.

# **Stack**
- Python 3.9.6
- Flask 2.3.2
- WTForms 1.1.1
- Jinja 3.1.2
